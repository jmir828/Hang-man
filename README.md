# Hang-man

Lot of work still needed.

First priority is to remove "Color" game and "Sudoku" game. Leaving only the main Hang-man game.

Next priority is to make new window same as initial. 
  After a complete run through, a new window is created. This window does not match the initial window.
  it should look the same.
  
Final Priority is to fix smaller bugs, then done!
